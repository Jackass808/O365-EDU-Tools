<#
.SYNOPSIS
This script is designed to create Information Barrier Policies for each SDS School AU and the 'All Teachers' Security Group created by SDS from an O365 tenant. 

.DESCRIPTION
This script will read from Azure, and output the administrative units to a csv.  Afterwards, you are prompted to confirm that you want to create the organization segments needed, then create and apply the information barrier policies.  A folder will be created in the same directory as the script itself and contains a log file which details the organization segments and information barrier policies created.  Nextlink in the log can be used for the skipToken script parameter to continue where the script left off in case it does not finish.  

.EXAMPLE
PS> .\Create-SDS_Information_Barriers.ps1

.NOTES
This script uses features required by Information Barriers version 3 or above enabled in your tenant.  Existing Organization Segments and Information Barriers created by a legacy version should be removed prior to upgrading.

========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. This script uses features required by Information Barriers version 3 or above enabled in your tenant.  

    a.  Existing Organization Segments and Information Barriers created by a legacy version should be removed prior to upgrading.

2. Install Microsoft Graph Powershell Module and Exchange Online Management Module with commands 'Install-Module Microsoft.Graph' and 'Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement'

3. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "connect-graph -scopes AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All" to bring up a sign-in UI. 
    
    c. Sign in with any tenant administrator credentials
    
    d. If you are returned to the PowerShell session without error, you are correctly set up

4.  Ensure that All Teachers security group is enabled in SDS and exists in Azure Active Directory.  

5.  Retry this script.  If you still get an error about failing to load the Microsoft Graph module, troubleshoot why "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -MinimumVersion 0.9.1" isn't working and do the same for the Exchange Online Management Module.
